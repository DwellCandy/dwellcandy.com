    <p>Victoria Solomon started Victoria Elizabeth Design, an East Coast company, with the belief that anyone can identify their style and live in their dream home. After years of experience working in-house with world re-known interior designers, she was inspired to craft her own style of design. Her design style mixes elegant lines with unexpected colors and textures, all the while reflecting her client's unique personalities and tastes.</p>
    <p>Victoria works on both residential and commercial projects across New England including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.</p>
